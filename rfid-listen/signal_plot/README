GNU-radio file sink blocks generate hexadecimal files where the signal is recorded. Such hex files cannot be directly plotted by tools like gnuplot for istance.
In this directory you find a ./conv tool which converts hex gnuradio files to text files. 
Launch:

./conv in_hex_file out_txt_file begin_offset number_of_samples
  
where:

- in_hex_file is the gnuradio hex file you want to convert
- out_txt_file is the output text file
- begin_offset is the point (in number of samples) of the hex file where you want the conversion starts
- number_of_samples is the number of samples you want to convert (starting from begin_offset)

At this point you can plot the out_txt_file using gnuplot:

gnuplot
gnuplot> plot out_txt_file using 1:2 every ::0::number_of_samples with lines


Enjoy :)
